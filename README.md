# SQA Resources (NOT WORKING)

## What is this?

This is a repository to provide resources to students sitting SQA exams: National 4, National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher

## Why open source?

This allows anyone to add/remove old and new resources or even upload their own resources they have created. This also allows peer reviewing of resources to insure that incorrect information is ironed out.

## How to run?

1. Install [npm](npmjs.com)
2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Cryptizism/sqa-resources`
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Access `localhost:3000`
6. *(Optional)* If you wish to fork and have GitHub pages work change `site` in `astro.config.mjs` to `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io` or `https://my-custom-domain.com`

## How to add changes?

There is currently no guidance for adding changes. This will come as the project becomes usable.
